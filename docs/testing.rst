Testing Procedure
=====================

Test scenarios are set up in SEPIA under the test directory and can be run from the home directory with ./run_all_test.sh. The status of these tests can be seen at https://github.com/lanl/SEPIA so that manual testing should not be necessary.

Additionally, the jupyter notebooks found in the examples directory can be manually tested with ./run_all_notebooks.sh. Running the notebooks simply ensures there are no bugs preventing evaluation.
