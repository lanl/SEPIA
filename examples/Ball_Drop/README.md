In this directory you will find 5 notebooks with varying levels of complexity. All follow a similar experiment, the details of which can be read at the beginning of ball_drop_1.ipynb, and ball_drop_2.ipynb.

  1. ball_drop_1.ipynb: details and implements the simplest of the ball drop experiments. We calibrate only 1 parameter.
  2. ball_drop_1_concise.ipynb: mimics ball_drop_1.ipynb but makes use of some sepia shortcuts
  3. ball_drop_1_ragged.ipynb: shows how to implement the ball drop problem with ragged observed data
  4. ball_drop_2.ipynb: implements the ball drop example but additionally estimates the coefficient of gravity
  5. ball_drop_2_ragged.ipynb: ball_drop_2.ipynb with ragged observed data
